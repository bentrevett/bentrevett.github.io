        <div id="rules">
            <ul>
            <li>If any of the stacks are empty, add a card to the stack listed above.</li>
            <li>If the stack from above is full, click again to get a new stack.</li>
            <li>If the stack from above is "none", flip the next card and take that stack.</li>
            <li>If all stacks are full, take from the stack above.</li>
            <li>If the stack it tries to take from is empty, keep clicking until it receives a valid stack to take from.</li>
            </ul>
        The automata scores positive points for all stacks. It never scores negative points. <br>
        If the automata picks up any jokers, add them to the color which will give the automata the greatest increase in points. <br>
