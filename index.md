# Me

I have a first class honors masters degree in Digital Electronics from the University of Sheffield.

I'm currently doing a PhD at the Heriot-Watt University on applying natural language processing based machine learning algorithms to programming languages.

My research interests also include reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms.

I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts and playing board games. I'm also trying to learn German, but it's not going very well.

## Projects

- **[pytorch-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis)**: A tutorial on how to implement some common deep learning based sentiment analysis (text classification) models in PyTorch with torchtext, specifically the NBOW, GRU, bi-LSTM, CNN and Transformer models. Somehow got popular and has quite a few stars.
- **[pytorch-seq2seq](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq)**: A tutorial implementing neural (deep learning based) sequence-to-sequence models in PyTorch with torchtext, by implementing six NMT papers. Also has quite a few stars and was used as a basis for the [official PyTorch language translation tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/torchtext_translation_tutorial.html).
- **[pytorch-image-classification](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification)**: A tutorial covering how to implement some deep learning computer vision models in PyTorch with torchvision. Covers: a basic multi-layer perceptron, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG and ResNet.
- **[a-tour-of-optimizers](https://github.com/bentrevett/a-tour-of-pytorch-optimizers)**: A tutorial on common optimization algorithms used for neural networks, including: SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop and Adam.
- **[snake](https://bentrevett.com/projects/snake.html)**: Snake in Javascript.
- **[difference](https://bentrevett.com/projects/difference.html)**: A timed mental maths game in Javascript
- **[notes](https://github.com/bentrevett/notes)**: My personal [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes in Markdown. The notes are created with [vscode-memo](https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo) but should be compatible with any Markdown rendering note-taking tool, such as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Posts

One of my 2021 resolutions is to write more. Most of the writing will be about machine learning, programming and tech.
