# About Me

I'm currently working as an NLP Engineer @ [aveni](https://www.aveni.ai).

I have a PhD from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) on applying natural language processing based machine learning algorithms to programming languages, as well as a first class honors masters degree in Digital Electronics from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

In my spare time I enjoy: reading, listening to podcasts, playing board games, and watching baseball.

## Projects

- **[GloVedle](projects/glovedle/index.html)**: A version of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) using [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) embeddings.
- **[Wordle Terminal](https://github.com/bentrevett/wordle-terminal)**: A Python port of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) which is played in the terminal.
- **[UUIDv4 Generator](projects/uuid/index.html)**: A tool for generating UUIDv4s, because I didn't like the way the top result on Google generated them.
- **[easynlp](https://github.com/easynlp/easynlp)**: A library for performing natural language processing - such as zero-shot classification, translation, named entity recognition, summarization, and question answering - inference on given data utilizing the pre-trained models from [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
- **[pytorch-sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis)**: A tutorial on how to implement some common deep learning based sentiment analysis (text classification) models in PyTorch with torchtext, specifically the NBOW, GRU, bi-LSTM, CNN and Transformer models. Somehow got popular and has quite a few stars.
- **[pytorch-seq2seq](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq)**: A tutorial implementing neural (deep learning based) sequence-to-sequence models in PyTorch with torchtext, by implementing six NMT papers. Also has quite a few stars and was used as a basis for the [official PyTorch language translation tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/torchtext_translation_tutorial.html).
- **[pytorch-image-classification](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification)**: A tutorial covering how to implement some deep learning computer vision models in PyTorch with torchvision. Covers: a basic multi-layer perceptron, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG and ResNet.
- **[a-tour-of-optimizers](https://github.com/bentrevett/a-tour-of-pytorch-optimizers)**: A tutorial on common optimization algorithms used for neural networks, including: SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop and Adam.
- **[snake](projects/snake.html)**: Snake in Javascript.
- **[difference](projects/difference.html)**: A timed mental maths game in Javascript
