# Weak Links V

<span class="date">2022-07-08</span>

Of course, like almost everybody, I stopped posting on a regular basis for various reasons. [Life finds a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjQ3hA9mEA) (to get in the way). On a related note: I didn't think Jurassic World 3 was as bad as reviewers say. Sure, it wasn't great, but a [38 on metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-world-dominion)?!

Anyway, picking up on where we left off. I did lots of tweaks on this site recently because that gave me the feeling like I'm doing something, even though it's the equivalent of just sweeping dust from one corner of the room to the other. I added dates to the posts because it feels weird to have someone go through the posts and have no indication when they were published. I also did some shuffling about of the posts section on the main page -- combining both the weak links and other posts together into a reverse chronological list, removing the short descriptions and replacing them with tags.

One thing I'd like to add is an RSS feed, because I haven't done one before.

## Links

### [bearblog](https://www.bearblog.dev)

I seriously considered moving the posts to bearblog. It fits with my ethos of a very minimal blog with no fluff, and also upgrading to premium is a small one-off fee instead of a monthly subscription. However, I like having my posts and site to have a coherent theme, and I like tweaking things myself -- it at least teaches me a little bit of HTML and CSS.

### [Subscriptions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32129574)

The only subscriptions I have are:

- My phone provider
- Netflix
- Disney Plus
- Amazon Prime
- Spotify
- MLB
- The Economist
- iCloud

That already feels a lot to me. I don't understand how anyone could justify a subscription to a weather app. It just seems absurd.

### Test Time Augmentation

I recently found out about test time augmentation (TTA), in which you apply augmentations not only when training, but also when evaluating on the validation/test sets. When applying TTA, you average the predictions across each augmentation to make your final prediction.

It seems to be effective for computer vision (I first read about it in [Jeremy Howard's Kaggle tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/small-models-road-to-the-top-part-2)), and there is [some research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13607) in applying it to text.

### [raindrop](https://www.raindrop.io)

The way I used to "save" interesting articles (which I didn't have time to go through in detail) I found on my phone was by screenshotting them. Then, once a week or so, I would go through my screenshots, actually read the articles and add them to my notes. If I found an article while on my desktop I'd bookmark them to an "Inbox" folder, and do the same thing. There was this mismatch between having lots of screenshots and bookmarks, and having them in two separate places didn't sit right with me.

I came across [raindrop](https://www.raindrop.io) which is a bookmark manager. On my phone I can "share" to raindrop, and on the desktop there's an extension which adds things to raindrop. Now all my saved articles are all in one place. Of course, having the time to actually go through these articles is another story, and usually most of the saved articles I come back to I've later found that I have no interest in actually reading anymore.

### [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron)

I moved all my notes from [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md/) (a stand-alone Electron app) to [Dendron](https://www.github.com/dendronhq/dendron) (a Visual Studio Code extension). I didn't really use many of the features of Obsidian -- e.g. extensions -- and I spent most of my time in Visual Studio Code anyway.

I do still think the personal knowledge management (PKM) fad is a lot of false productivity, i.e. a lot of time organizing notes is just pointless busywork. But I do like writing notes, even if I never go back to them. I find it useful to write something down as if I were explaining it to someone else as it helps me clarify my understanding of a subject.
