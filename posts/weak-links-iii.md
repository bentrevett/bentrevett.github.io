# Weak Links III

got on fine with using bare URLs until this post when i had a super long link. why haven't i noticed this before? is there a correlation between concise urls and quality of posts? shorter urls usually imply the posts are from a personal website which usually, in my opinion, are higher quality than posts on social media websites which usually have long urls full of tracking information.
