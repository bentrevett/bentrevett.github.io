You may have heard of *vector databases* and companies such as [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) (to name a few). What these companies do is allow you to upload your chunks and specify a model used to create text embeddings from your chunks. Then, you can send a query via their API and they will do similar to what we've done above in the retrieval step: find relevant chunks using your query. They do a little more than that, but that's basically how they work!"
