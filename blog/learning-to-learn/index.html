  <h1>Learning to Learn</h1>
  
  <p>I'm going to start writing a proper blog (again). I, like many people, have tried to consistently write a blog several times now and always give up finding that I never have time to write and
  then simply lose interest. However, inspired by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">Paul Graham</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">Steve Yegge</a> I have
  decided to give it yet another go.</p>
  
  <p>Why do I think this time will go a bit better than the others? For one, I actually think I have much more to say now. Before I used to blog about music and nobody really
  cares what I have to think about music, not even me. This time I'm going to blog about PhDs and technology, something a lot more interesting and as I've decided to invest
  four years of my life embarking on a PhD, I actually do care (just a little) about it. I also am spending a lot of time learning, which means I spend a lot of time thinking
  and scribbling down ideas, and I like the idea of cleaning those ideas up and writing them in a (hopefully) presentable form.</p>
  
  <p>I want to spend this first blog mainly talking about what I'm up to now and how I'm learning to learn. After finishing my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering in June
  I have taken the (semi-)radical career change of doing a PhD in machine learning, which is basically computer science. I think this goes to highlight just how bizarre my educational
  career has been. I started out by failing half my GCSEs because I was a cocky brat, then dropping out of college after one semester, then doing an apprenticeship to be an electrician,
  then a 'foundation year' at university (basically a maths, physics, chemistry and a bit of further maths), then an electronic engineering bachelors degree, then a digital electronics
  masters degree and now (finally) a PhD in machine learning.</p>

  <p>This electronic engineering to computer science change has been spurred on because of my interest in programming. I was addicted to playing video games as a kid, with my dad always 
  telling me that I should "go out and make my own games", but I always dismissed it as something that was beyond me. However, after studying C programming in the first year of my degree, I 
  finally saw that programming wasn't some magic voodoo art at all! It was just logic, and I loved it. I seriously considered switching degrees throughout university and was very close to
  doing a masters in computer science, but I still did enjoy engineering, so decided to stick it out to the end. And now here I am, finally doing computer science, finally programming, right?
  Well, not really.</p>

  <p>It turns out that doing a PhD is mostly theoretical (who'd have guessed?) and the majority of programming is hacking up quick prototypes to test hypotheses before writing a paper on them.
    That's actually not such a bad thing for me though! As my CS skills are still developing, pretty much everything I program looks like a hacked up prototype anyway! I don't want it to stay
    like this though, as the best machine learning PhD students, such as <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> (who also blogs), are usually the ones that seem like the most
    interesting and smartest people. So, I've been teaching myself to program, with mixed results. </p>

<p>Luckily, there's a lot of programming resources on the internet, it's probably common type of MOOC course. Unluckily, I'm a habitual starter and only an occasional finisher. I'm currently
  learning about 6 programming languages due to the logic of: something something a great programmer learns loads of language because something something if you have a hammer everything looks
  like a nail. I'm reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> and <a href="http://www.htdp.org/">HtDP</a> that have a philosophy of how you shouldn't 
  learn a programming language, you should instead learn how to program. I'm building up my mathematical background after having forgotten most of it by reading books on linear algebra, 
  probability and statistics. Oh yeah, did I also mention I've never studied machine learning before, so I'm also reading about 4 books about machine learning, deep learning and natural language
  processing.</p>
