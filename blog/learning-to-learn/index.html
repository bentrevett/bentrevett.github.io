  <h1>Learning to Learn</h1>
  
  <p>I'm going to start writing a proper blog (again). I, like many people, have tried to consistently write a blog several times now and always give up finding that I never have time to write and
  then simply lose interest. However, inspired by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html">Paul Graham</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">Steve Yegge</a> I have
  decided to give it yet another go.</p>
  
  <p>Why do I think this time will go a bit better than the others? For one, I actually think I have much more to say now. Before I used to blog about music and nobody really
  cares what I have to think about music, not even me. This time I'm going to blog about PhDs and technology, something a lot more interesting and as I've decided to invest
  four years of my life embarking on a PhD, I actually do care (just a little) about it. I also am spending a lot of time learning, which means I spend a lot of time thinking
  and scribbling down ideas, and I like the idea of cleaning those ideas up and writing them in a (hopefully) presentable form.</p>
  
  <p>I want to spend this first blog mainly talking about what I'm up to now and how I'm learning to learn. After finishing my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering in June
  I have taken the (semi-)radical career change of doing a PhD in machine learning, which is basically computer science. I think this goes to highlight just how bizarre my educational
  career has been. I started out by failing half my GCSEs because I was a cocky brat, then dropping out of college after one semester, then doing an apprenticeship to be an electrician,
  then a 'foundation year' at university (basically a maths, physics, chemistry and a bit of further maths), then an electronic engineering bachelors degree, then a digital electronics
  masters degree and now (finally) a PhD in machine learning.</p>

  <p>This electronic engineering to computer science change has been spurred on because of my interest in programming. I was addicted to playing video games as a kid, with my dad always 
  telling me that I should "go out and make my own games", but I always dismissed it as something that was beyond me. However, after studying C programming in the first year of my degree, I 
  finally saw that programming wasn't some magic voodoo art at all! It was just logic, and I loved it. I seriously considered switching degrees throughout university and was very close to
  doing a masters in computer science, but I still did enjoy engineering, so decided to stick it out to the end. And now here I am, finally doing computer science, finally programming, right?
  Well, not really.</p>

  <p>It turns out that doing a PhD is mostly theoretical (who'd have guessed?) and the majority of programming is hacking up quick prototypes to test hypotheses before writing a paper on them.
  That's actually not such a bad thing for me though! As my CS skills are still developing, pretty much everything I program looks like a hacked up prototype anyway! I don't want it to stay
  like this though, as the best machine learning PhD students, such as <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> (who also blogs), are usually the ones that seem like the most
  interesting and smartest people. So, I've been teaching myself to program, with mixed results. </p>

  <p>Luckily, there's a lot of programming resources on the internet, it's probably the most common type of MOOC course. Unluckily, I'm a habitual starter and only an occasional finisher. I'm currently
  learning about multiple programming languages due to the logic of: something something a great programmer learns loads of language because something something if you have a hammer everything looks
  like a nail. I'm reading books that have a philosophy of how you shouldn't learn a programming language, you should instead learn how to program. I'm reading about computer architecture, compilers, 
  data structures and algorithms. I'm building up my mathematical background after having forgotten most of it by reading books on linear algebra,probability and statistics. Oh yeah, did I also mention 
  I've never studied machine learning before? Because I'm also reading about a lot of books about machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing and I'm doing about similar MOOCs. And all 
  of this is all alongside doing my actual research.</p>

  <p>You might be thinking that all sounds terrile and my life is a living hell, but I'm actually really enjoying myself! I'm pretty sure that studying a PhD is the only chance people get in their lives
  to earn some money whilst doing an incredile amount of self-development, all without anyone telling them what to do (sort of). Does it all get a bit much sometimes? Definitely. Am I stressing out because
  I haven't finished a chapter of a book I aimed to finish this week? Definitely not. I'm free to pick and choose what I want to learn. After doing my research for the day I can do whatever I feel like doing,
  and it's the best thing in the world. I'm sure nobody wants to read a list of ways to learn, but I'm doing to write my thoughts anyway.</p>

  <p><b>Variety is the spice of life.</b> MOOCs are great. Books are great. Exercises are great. Can you learn a subject just doing a single one? Yes. Should you? No. MOOCs are very popular right now and for all of
  the subjects I'm studying there are a wide range of excellent MOOCs available from sites such as <a hre="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT</a>
  and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>. However, MOOCs aren't something you should marathon by watching a whole 12 weeks worth of content at 2x speed. Trust me, I've tried it. Books and MOOCs
  go hand in hand. A video of a MOOC gives you a nice hour long overview of a topic and the book will allow you to read to help you digest the information. End of video exercises on MOOCs and end of chapter
  exercises on books should always be done using the <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/ProblemSolvingTechniques.html">Feynman Algorithm</a>. There is no way to learn a concept without 
  thinking hard, and solutions should definitely not be looked at until you've given a serious attempt at a solution.</p>
 
  <p><b>Read things that aren't studying.</b> I'm sure everyone is sick to death of other people telling them to read and how great reading is, but there's a reason why they keep telling you. Reading is the best
  hobby I have ever got into and I'm going to do it until I die. There are so many interesting books out there both fiction and non-fiction. If you have an interest in something, someone will have written
  a book about it, and if you read it you will learn something new. Without making it sound like books are a magical wonder cure, I don't think I'd have been the person I am today without having read so much.</p>

  <p><b>Concentrating is hard, burning out is easy.</b> For me, concentration comes in waves. Sometimes I'll be able to read research papers for 6 hours non-stop. Sometimes I'll give up after 10 minutes. Sometimes
  I'll come across a few papers that I <b>have</b> to read today, and after the first one I'll feel like quitting my PhD. </p>
