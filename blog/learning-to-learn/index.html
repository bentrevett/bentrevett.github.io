  <h1>Learning to Learn</h1>
  
  <p>I'm going to start writing a proper blog (again). I, like many people, have tried to consistently write a blog several times now and always give up finding that I never have time to write and
  then simply lose interest. However, inspired by http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html and https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs I have
  decided to give it yet another go. </p>
  
  <p>Why do I think this time will go a bit better than the others? For one, I actually think I have much more to say now. Before I used to blog about music and nobody really
  cares what I have to think about music, not even me. This time I'm going to blog about PhDs and technology, something a lot more interesting and as I've decided to invest
  four years of my life embarking on a PhD, I actually do care (just a little) about it.</p>
  
  <p>I want to spend this first blog mainly talking about what I'm up to now and how I'm learning to learn. After finishing my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering in June
  I have taken the (semi-)radical career change of doing a PhD in machine learning, which is basically computer science. I think this goes to highlight just how bizarre my educational
  career has been. I started out failing half my GCSEs because I was a cocky brat, then dropping out of college after one semester, then doing an apprenticeship to be an electrician,
  then a 'foundation year' at university (basically a maths, physics, chemistry and a bit of further maths), then an electronic engineering bachelors degree, then a digital electronics
  masters degree and now (finally) a PhD in machine learning.</p>
