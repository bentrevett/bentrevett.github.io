	<h1>Python Disassembler</h1>
	
<p>The Python 'dis' module disassembled Python code into the individual instructions executed by the cPython interpreter for each line.
	Passing something to the 'dis.dis' function will return a human-readable representation of the disassembled bytecode. 
	The is useful for analyzing and hand-tuning code for optimizations.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	
<p>The 'dis.dis' function takes a function, method, class, module, code string, generator or byte sequence and prints out the disassembly of that code.
	In the case of the class, it will disassemble each method. For a module, it disassembles all functions in that module.
</p>
	{% highlight python %}
	import dis
       
    def foo():
        x = 10
        y = 40
        z = x + y 
        return z

    def main():
        dis.dis(foo)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
		main(){% endhighlight %}
<p>
    This will print:
</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    4           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (10)
                3 STORE_FAST               0 (x)

    5           6 LOAD_CONST               2 (40)
                9 STORE_FAST               1 (y)

    6           12 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
                15 LOAD_FAST                1 (y)
                18 BINARY_ADD
                19 STORE_FAST               2 (z)

    7           22 LOAD_FAST                2 (z)
		25 RETURN_VALUE {% endhighlight %}
<p>
    You can also disassemble an enitre Python file via 'python -m dis file_name.py'.
    Each column of the disassembly output gives the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The line in the Python file the disassembler is referring to</li>
        <li>The address of the bytecode instruction</li>
        <li>The name of the bytecode instruction</li>
        <li>The index of arguement in the code block's name and constant table</li>
        <li>The human readable mapping from arguement index to the actual value name being referred to</li>
    </ol>	
<p>
	The 4th column is a little complex, but you just need to know that all 'code objects' in Python (that is a code block like a function) have their own internal name and constant tables.
	These tables are just lists, where the constant table holds constants such a literal strings, numbers and special values such as 'None' that appear at least once in the code block. 
	The name table holds a list of variable names. 
	These variables names are keys into a dictionary that maps symbols to actual values. 
	The reason why instruction arguments are indices into tables and not that values into tables is that aarguments can then be uniform length (always two bytes). 
	Storing variable length strings in the bytecode directly makes advancing the program counter a lot more complicated.

    <h2>Code Objects</h2>
    <p>Code objects are the compiled representation of a piece of Python code. 
    This can then be understood by the cPython interpreter which uses the code objects to execute Python code line at a time.
    You can use the '__code__' member of all functions and methods to generate the code object, for example:</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    def foo():
        pass
    
    print(foo.__code__){% endhighlight %}
<p>
	This then prints out:</p>
    {% highlight python %}<code object foo at 0x109d419c0, file "example.py, line 1>{% endhighlight %}<p>
   Code objects provide all the information the Python interpreter needs to execute the code represented by the object.
	    The code object has a few attributes, such as:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>co_code: the actual bytecode byte string</li>
   <li>co_consts: the constants available to the instructions, i.e. the constants table</li>
   <li>co_names: the global symbols available to the instructions</li>
   <li>co_nlocals: the number of local symbols (functions and variables></li>
   <li>co_varnames: the list of local symbols (functions and variables</li>
   <li>co_argcount: if the code object is a function, the number of arguments it takes</li>
   </ul><p>
	    For example, for the following function:</p>
   {% highlight python %}
    def foo():
        x = 5
        def bar():
            pass
        return len([x]){% endhighlight %}<p>
    The code object of 'foo' will have the constants (co_consts) None and 5, the local variable names (co_varnames) 'bar' and 'x', and the available symbols (co_names) 'len'.</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    foo.__code__.co_consts == (None, 5)
    foo.__code__.co_varnames == ('bar', 'x')
    foo.__code__.co_names == ('len',){% endhighlight %}
