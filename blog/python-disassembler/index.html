title: Ben Trevett | Python Disassembler
---
	<h1>Python Disassembler</h1>
	
<p>The Python 'dis' module disassembled Python code into the individual instructions executed by the cPython interpreter for each line.
	Passing something to the 'dis.dis' function will return a human-readable representation of the disassembled bytecode. 
	The is useful for analyzing and hand-tuning code for optimizations.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	
<p>The 'dis.dis' function takes a function, method, class, module, code string, generator or byte sequence and prints out the disassembly of that code.
	In the case of the class, it will disassemble each method. For a module, it disassembles all functions in that module.
</p>
	{% highlight python %}
    import dis
       
    def foo():
        x = 10
        y = 40
        z = x + y 
        return z

    def main():
        dis.dis(foo)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
		main(){% endhighlight %}
<p>
    This will print:
</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    4           0 LOAD_CONST                1 (10)
                3 STORE_FAST                0 (x)

    5           6 LOAD_CONST                2 (40)
                9 STORE_FAST                1 (y)

    6           12 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
                15 LOAD_FAST                1 (y)
                18 BINARY_ADD
                19 STORE_FAST               2 (z)

    7           22 LOAD_FAST                2 (z)
                25 RETURN_VALUE {% endhighlight %}
<p>
    You can also disassemble an enitre Python file via 'python -m dis file_name.py'.
    Each column of the disassembly output gives the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The line in the Python file the disassembler is referring to</li>
        <li>The address of the bytecode instruction</li>
        <li>The name of the bytecode instruction</li>
        <li>The index of arguement in the code block's name and constant table</li>
        <li>The human readable mapping from arguement index to the actual value name being referred to</li>
    </ol>	
<p>
	The 4th column is a little complex, but you just need to know that all 'code objects' in Python (that is a code block like a function) have their own internal name and constant tables.
	These tables are just lists, where the constant table holds constants such a literal strings, numbers and special values such as 'None' that appear at least once in the code block. 
	The name table holds a list of variable names. 
	These variables names are keys into a dictionary that maps symbols to actual values. 
	The reason why instruction arguments are indices into tables and not that values into tables is that aarguments can then be uniform length (always two bytes). 
	Storing variable length strings in the bytecode directly makes advancing the program counter a lot more complicated. 
</p> 

    <h2>Code Objects</h2>
    <p>Code objects are the compiled representation of a piece of Python code. 
    This can then be understood by the cPython interpreter which uses the code objects to execute Python code line at a time.
    You can use the '__code__' member of all functions and methods to generate the code object, for example:</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    def foo():
        pass
    
    print(foo.__code__){% endhighlight %}
<p>
	This then prints out:</p>
    {% highlight python %}<code object foo at 0x109d419c0, file "example.py, line 1>{% endhighlight %}<p>
   Code objects provide all the information the Python interpreter needs to execute the code represented by the object.
	    The code object has a few attributes, such as:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>co_code: the actual bytecode byte string</li>
   <li>co_consts: the constants available to the instructions, i.e. the constants table</li>
   <li>co_names: the global symbols available to the instructions</li>
   <li>co_nlocals: the number of local symbols (functions and variables></li>
   <li>co_varnames: the list of local symbols (functions and variables</li>
   <li>co_argcount: if the code object is a function, the number of arguments it takes</li>
   </ul><p>
	    For example, for the following function:</p>
   {% highlight python %}
    def foo():
        x = 5
        def bar():
            pass
        return len([x]){% endhighlight %}<p>
    The code object of 'foo' will have the constants (co_consts) None and 5, the local variable names (co_varnames) 'bar' and 'x', and the available symbols (co_names) 'len'.</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    foo.__code__.co_consts == (None, 5)
    foo.__code__.co_varnames == ('bar', 'x')
    foo.__code__.co_names == ('len',){% endhighlight %}
    <h2>Understanding Disassembled Code</h2>
    <p>
    Now we understand code objects, we can look at the output of 'dis.dis' to understand it better. Let's take a look at the output of the disassembly of the following function:
    </p>
    {% highlight python %}
    import dis
    
    y = 5
    
    def foo():
        x = len([1,2,3])
        z = x + y
        return z
    
    dis.dis(foo){% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    The output is:
    </p>
    {% highlight python %}
    6           0 LOAD_GLOBAL               0 (len)
                3 LOAD_CONST                1 (1)
                6 LOAD_CONST                2 (2)
                9 LOAD_CONST                3 (3)
                12 BUILD_LIST               3
                15 CALL_FUNCTION            1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair)
                18 STORE_FAST               0 (x)

    7           21 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
                24 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (y)
                27 BINARY_ADD
                28 STORE_FAST               1 (z)

    8           31 LOAD_FAST                1 (z)
                34 RETURN_VALUE{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    The 'LOAD_GLOBAL' instruction on the first line is from the 6th line of the Python code. 
    It loads the name at index 0. Recall this index is refering the co_names list associated with the disassembled code object.
    The last column, len, is simply the human readable version to what the value at co_names[0] is.
    </p>
    <p>
    What does LOAD_GLOBAL do? It loads a global, in this case the global function (symbol) is len. Where does it load it to?
    That is decided by how the cPython interpret is structured. It is entirely stack-based, which means any function or method symbols, constants or variable names are added to a stack.
    Operations such as binary addition (via the BINARY_ADD bytecode instruction) will operate on this stack, popping two values and pushing the result back onto the stack.
    Function call instructions (CALL_FUNCTION) will pop the function symbol and arguements from the stack, execute the function (which pushes a new frame onto the stack) and ultimately push the return value of the called function back onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
    A few of the instructions understood by cPython are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>'LOAD_FAST <index>': pushes the local ariable at the given index on to the stack</li>
    <li>'STORE_GLOBAL <index>': pops the top of the stack into the variable with the name specificed at the given index</li>
    <li>'BINARY_ADD': pops the top two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back on to the stack</li>
    <li>'BUILD_LIST <size>': pops 'size' many elements off the stack and allocates a new list</li>
    <li>'CALL FUNCTION <#arguments>': pops '#arguments' many arguments off the stack. The lower byte of this number specifies the number of positional arguments, the high byte the number of keyword arguments. Then pops the function symbol itself off the stack, makes the call and pushes the return value of the function back onto the stack.</li>
    <li>'MAKE_FUNCTION <#arguments>': used to create a function object, consumes: all default arguments in positional order, the code object of the function and the qualified name of the function from the stack and then pushes the created function object onto the stack</li>
    <li>'POP_TOP': pops (removes) the value at the top of the stack</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
    So, what's the point of all this? It can be used to investigating when the Python compiler performs optimizations and when it doesn't.
    For example, take the following code:
    </p>
    {% highlight python %}
    i = 1+2
    f = 3.4 * 5.6
    s = 'Hello, ' + 'World!'
    
    I = i * 3 * 4
    F = f / 2 / 3
    S = s + ' Bye!'{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    Doing disassembly on this gives:

    <p>
    As you can see, the compiler will perform simple arithmetic operations and string concatenations at compile time.
    However, as soon as a variable is involved, the compiler stops optimizing and loads the variable name and all constants individually, then performs the binary operations one at a time in the order of operation.
    </p>
    <h2>Loop Comparison</h2>
    <p>
    In Python, we usually use 'for' to create looping blocks. However, lets compare the efficiency to a 'while' loop.
    That is, we are comparing</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    for i in range(x):
        pass
    
    i = 0
    while i < x:
        i += 1{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    To compare how long they take, we can use the 'timeit' module:</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    import timeit
    
    x = timeit.timeit('for i in range(x): pass', globals=dict(x=100))
    print("for = {}".format(x))
    
    y = timeit.timeit('i = 0\nwhile i < x: i += 1', globals=dict(x=100))
    print("while = {}".format(y)){% endhighlight %}
    <p>This gives an output of:</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    range = 1.3247587516772623
    while = 5.678850951312154{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
    As you can see, the range function is much faster, but why? First, let's disassemble the code of the for loop.
    </p>
    {% highlight python %}
    2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (100)

    3           6 SETUP_LOOP               20 (to 29)
              	9 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (range)
             	12 LOAD_FAST               0 (x)
             	15 CALL_FUNCTION           1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair)

    <p>Now for the while loop:</p>
    {% highlight python %}
    2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (100)
              	3 STORE_FAST               0 (x)

    3           6 LOAD_CONST               2 (0)
              	9 STORE_FAST               1 (i)

    4          	12 SETUP_LOOP              26 (to 41)
           >>   15 LOAD_FAST                1 (i)
             	18 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)

             	27 LOAD_FAST                1 (i)
             	30 LOAD_CONST               3 (1)
             	33 INPLACE_ADD
             	34 STORE_FAST               1 (i)
             	37 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           15
           >>   40 POP_BLOCK
           >>   41 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             	44 RETURN_VALUE{% endhighlight %}
    <p>As we can see, using the range function has fewer instructions. 
    This is due to the range instruction being internally optimized for the underlying C code, the 'while' version requires repeated use of IN_PLACE_ADD, COMPARE_OP and POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE operations, which take more time.
