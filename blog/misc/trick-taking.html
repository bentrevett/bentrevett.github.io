    <h1>An Introduction to Trick-Taking Games</h1>
        
        <p>
            I have recently got into card games and I thought I'd write about my favourite genre of card games - trick-taking games. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Why do I like trick-taking games? 
            First, they're usually just a deck of cards, meaning they're cheap, compact and easy to get to the table. 
            This also means there is no set-up time except from shuffling a deck and explaining the rules. 
            As they're constrained by their contents (just a deck of cards) they're usually not too rules heavy, meaning they're appropriate for inexperienced gamers or younger players.
            Second, almost everyone has some experience with card games in the past, so there's a level of familiarity there. 
            Compare that to when you try and introduce people to a large scale modern board game and as soon as they see a large board covered in iconography their brains will begin to switch off.
            Finally, they require skill to be great at, but due to the luck of the draw even an inexperienced player can pull off a win sometimes.
            Some people may see this as a bad thing, but learning to play with the hand that you're dealt is part of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll first go over how a standard trick-taking game works and then go into climbing games, which are seen as a subset of trick-taking games.
            Then I'll do a short description of ones I have played and would recommend for people looking to get into these sort of games.
            If you just want to quickly see which to buy, scroll to the bottom for the recommended games at each player count and pick one appropriate for your group size.

        <h2>Recommended Trick-Taking Games</h2>

            <p> 
                Below is a list of the trick-taking games I would recommend with a short description of each of them. 
                Not all of these work well with all player counts, see the list at the very bottom to get a quick overview of which games to check out for your number of players.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are not ordered best to worst, but I've tried to group similar ones together. The main three groups are: trick evasion, unique scoring methods and bidding.
            </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6887/hearts">Hearts</a></h3>

                <p>
                    This is the king of trick evasion games, with the aim of the game being to avoid taking certain tricks and to have the lowest score. 
                    The game plays as standard trick taking (standard deck of cards, must follow suit) with no trump suit, passing 3 cards to another player at the start of each round. 
                    The catch? Every heart card you win gets you +1 point and the Queen of spades gives you +13 points.
                    Hearts cannot be lead until they have been "broken", i.e. played off suit.
                    You also have the ability to "shoot the moon", which is when you take all of the point giving cards in a round. 
                    This will mean you don't gain any points and all other players gain 26 (or you just lose 26 points in some variants).
                    There is a variant which I like where the Jack of diamonds gives you -10 points.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    A key tactic is to void yourself of certain suits so you can discard whatever you want when those suits are led. 
                    It's also to important to constantly be thinking of the queen of hearts and how you can lose the next trick once you win one (as to avoid people giving you point cards).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is probably the first trick-taking game everyone should try, there are plenty of ways to play this online against computers to get a feel of it. 
                    The only downside about playing this with real people is that it only really works with exactly 4. 
                    However, it only uses a standard deck of cards so it's easy to get going.
                </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225482/texas-showdown">Texas Showdown</a></h3>

                <p>
                    This is another trick evasion game, but without a standard deck. 
                    The deck has 60 cards numbered 0 to 74 in 8 different (cowboy themed) suits. 
                    There are 11 cards in the lowest suit (0-11), 10 cards in the next suit (11-20), 9 cards in the next suit (21-29), all the way up to 4 cards in the highest suit (71-74).
                    Each card also has an indicator of how many are in that suit and if that card is the highest within the suit.
                    If you can't follow the lead suit, you can play any card but the next player must follow either of those 2 suits (if they can). 
                    The winner of the trick is decided by who has the highest card in the most common suit within the trick (ties broken by highest card winning the trick).
                    There's also a neat rule where if you win a trick with the highest card of that suit you choose who will start the next trick. 
                    No special scoring here, just each trick is worth 1 point and you want to get the lowest score possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will definitely take some tricks per round, the skill is in being able to figure out how to lose the lead when you take it. 
                    I've also found a little bit of card counting in this game goes a long way to avoid taking the tricks from the higher numbered suits, especially remembering if the highest card in each suit has been played.
                    The ability to follow any of the suits in the trick does give you some opportunities to screw over certain players, which I find fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This plays 3-6 but I would only recommend at 5 or more as it doesn't work well with 3 and with 4 I'd rather play something else.
                    So if you're looking for a trick evasion game after getting sick of Hearts or your group is more than 4, then I would definitely recommend checking it out.
                </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/619/bottle-imp">The Bottle Imp</a></h3>
            
                <p>
                    Another trick evasion game with a unique deck numbered 1-37 in three suits. 
                    Most of the high cards are red, most of the low are yellow and the blue are inbetween.
                    Cards all have a number of coins on them which represent points to be won.
                    Suits must be followed and the highest card wins the trick. 
                    The spin is that the 19 card is "the bottle". If a card is played that is lower than the current value of the bottle, then this card wins the trick and the ownership of the bottle.
                    The value of the bottle is then set to the value of that card. If multiple people play lower than the bottle, the closest one below the value of the bottle wins.
                    At the start of the round each player sets one card face-down under the bottle. At the end of the round, the player who owns the bottle scores negative points for the coins on the cards underneath the bottle.
                    The other players will score positive points for each coin on the cards they have won. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    There is a good amount of thought required in trying to balance winning the most tricks as possible without taking the bottle, and also having a plan on how to get rid of the bottle if you do get it. 
                    If you have the yellow 1 and win with it then you will definitely be stuck with the bottle for the rest of the round, but if you lead with it and you know that the only other yellows are below the current price of the bottle then you're able to force someone else to take it. 
                    Maybe you'll go for the safer option of putting that yellow 1 underneath the bottle, but this will only give the loser a single negative point. Again, lots of decisions to make with only 37 cards!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is one of the best 3 player trick taking games but I would not recommend it with 2 or 4. 
                </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/354/sticheln">Stichlen</a></h3>

                <p>
                    That's right, yet another trick evasion game. 
                    This uses a deck of cards numbered 0-14 in 6 colours - though some of the cards are removed if you have less than 6 players.
                    Players simultaneously choose a "pain suit" and any cards taken in this colour are worth negative points equal to the number on the card, all other cards are worth +1 point.
                    The way to choose the winner of a trick takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you're not familiar with trick-taking games, but the rulebook explains it pretty well.
                    Basically, every suit that isn't the lead suit is trump for that trick, except if it's 0. Ties are broken by the earliest card played.
                    Everyone plays their hand of 14 cards, you add up the points and keep going for a number of rounds equal to the number of players.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a lot of strategy in picking your pain suit as the most positive points you can win in a trick is 4 and the most negative is -39 (in a 3 player game), thus avoiding taking negative points is a lot more important than trying to score positive points.
                    You want to pick a suit you have a few cards in, but are all relatively low value. 
                    This means if everyone else on the table all plays cards in your pain suit then you can follow suit (so you don't trump) and play a low card.
                    In reality, you'll probably have no suit in your hand where you have a few of them and they're all low - but that's part of the game!
                    You want to try and keep track of all the highest cards in your pain suit so someone after you doesn't force you to take a high card after you've just played one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is probably the best trick-taking game out there. 
                    Some people might not like the "take that" element of being able to screw someone over and making them take -20 or more points, but I'm ok with it.
                    I usually also don't like games where the biggest decisions are the very first ones, but if you give them the tip above (pick a suit with a few cards, relatively low) then they can pick it up quickly.
                    Those caveats aside, this game is great. It plays 3-6, with each player count having a different feel. It's very tight at 3-4, but more wild and unpredictable at 5-6. I'd recommend this to everyone.
                </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234248/voodoo-prince">Voodoo Prince</a></h3>

                <p>
                    This is sort of a trick evasion game. Sometimes you want to take tricks, sometimes you don't.
                    The game is played with 0-15 in 5 colours, with some of the higher cards removed when playing with less than 5 players. 
                    Once you win a certain number of tricks (3 in the 4 and 5 player game) you are out of the round and you score equal to the number of tricks taken by all other players. 
                    So if you take the first 3 tricks without anyone else taking any, you score nothing. The exception to this is the last remaining player, who only scores his own number of tricks. 
                    The trump suit is chosen randomly for the first round, but the last remaining player chooses the trump - after seeing his hand - in subsequent rounds.
                    There are 2 types of special cards. The 0 of each colour beats the highest number of that colour - 2/15 for a 4/5 player game. 
                    The 5s and 7s "split the trick", which basically means winning with either of those means your win counts as 2 tricks, instead of just 1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a typical Reiner Knizia game, simple rules which allow for strategic play. 
                    Ideally, you want to look at your hand and decide if it's worth staying in for a few more tricks to maximise your points, or to just play it safe and go out now.
                    The special cards do a good job of throwing a spanner in the works - either letting you take control with a 0 or quickly get yourself out of the round with a 5 or 7. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'll admit I haven't played this game as much as some of the others listed here - but the little I did play I enjoyed. 
                    The "push your luck" element of trying to stay in for a few more tricks creates some really fun gameplay.
                    The special cards are great, but I'm not sure what to make of the 5 and 7 both having the exact same power.
                    This plays from 2-5 - I've not played it at 2 or 3 player but have heard mixed things so I'd only recommend it at 4 and 5 for now.
                </p>

            <h3>&emsp;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221965/fox-forest">The Fox in the Forest</a></h3>

                <p>
                    This game is unique in that it's a trick-taker designed only for 2. 
                    It features 3 suits, numbered 1 to 11. Every odd card has a special ability, for example the 1 lets you begin the next trick even if you lose, the 3 lets you exchange the trump card with one from your hand, etc.
                    The game also features an asymmetric scoring system where if you take too many tricks you will score zero points and your opponent scores the maximum, whereas if you score just below the threshold you will score 6 and they will score 1.
                    Rounds are played until a player reaches a certain amount of points.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's difficult to find a good trick-taker for 2 players. 
                    Some trick-takers have variants for 2, but they always feel like an afterthought.
                    As this game was designed for - and can only be played by - 2 players it works really well. 
                    The special powers on the cards and the scoring system take some getting used to at first, but can be grasped after a few rounds.
                    The powers themselves are pretty crucial to the game working, being able to use a 3 to change the trump card to a suit you know your opponent is void in and you have plenty of is great to pull off.
                    The scoring allows you to potentially do well with a "bad" hand. All low cards? Force your opponent to take them all! All high cards? Find a way to avoid taking all the tricks and you'll get the maximum points!
                    Your strategy can be pretty adabtable, especially as some powers allow you to replace cards in your hand. Initially you might be going for no tricks, but depending on how the round goes you may end up getting the 6 points for 7-9 tricks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any interest of playing trick-taking games with 2 then you should definitely get this game.
                    It does have a little bit of a learning curve but the excellent reference cards help considerably.
                    It plays pretty quickly too, usually fast enough to get multiple games within 30 minutes. 
                    The artwork is also nice, if you're into that.
