    <h1>An Introduction to Trick-Taking Games</h1>
        
        <p>I have recently got into card games and I thought I'd write about my favourite genre of card games - trick-taking games. 
            Why do I like trick-taking games? 
            First, they're usually just a deck of cards, meaning they're cheap, compact and easy to get to the table. 
            This also means there is no set-up time except from shuffling a deck and explaining the rules. 
            As they're constrained by their contents (just a deck of cards) they're usually not too rules heavy, meaning they're appropriate for inexperienced gamers or younger players.
            Second, almost everyone has some experience with card games in the past, so there's a level of familiarity there. 
            Compare that to when you try and introduce people to a large scale modern board game and as soon as they see a large board covered in iconography their brains will begin to switch off.
            Finally, they require skill to be great at, but due to the luck of the draw even an inexperienced player can pull off a win sometimes.
            Some people may see this as a bad thing, but learning to play with the hand that you're dealt is part of the game.

            I'll first go over how a standard trick-taking game works and then go into climbing games, which are seen as a subset of trick-taking games.
            Then I'll do a short description of ones I have played and would recommend for people looking to get into these sort of games.
            If you just want to quickly see which to buy, scroll to the bottom for the recommended games at each player count and pick one appropriate for your group size.
