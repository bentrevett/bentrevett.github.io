    <h1>An Introduction to Trick-Taking Games</h1>
        
        I have recently got into card games and I thought I'd write about my favourite genre of card games - trick-taking games. 
        Why do I like trick-taking games? 
        First, they're usually just a deck of cards, meaning they're cheap, compact and easy to get to the table. 
        This also means there is no set-up time except from shuffling a deck and explaining the rules. 
        As they're constrained by their contents (just a deck of cards) they're usually not too rules heavy, meaning they're appropriate for inexperienced gamers or younger players.
        Second, almost everyone has some experience with card games in the past, so there's a level of familiarity there. 
        Compare that to when you try and introduce people to a large scale modern board game and as soon as they see a large board covered in iconography their brains will begin to switch off.
        Finally, they require skill to be great at, but due to the luck of the draw even an inexperienced player can pull off a win sometimes.
        Some people may see this as a bad thing, but learning to play with the hand that you're dealt is part of the game.

        I'll first go over how a standard trick-taking game works and then go into climbing games, which are seen as a subset of trick-taking games.
        Then I'll do a short description of ones I have played and would recommend for people looking to get into these sort of games.
        If you just want to quickly see which to buy, scroll to the bottom for the recommended games at each player count and pick one appropriate for your group size.

        <h2>Recommended Trick-Taking Games</h2>

            Below is a list of the trick-taking games I would recommend with a short description of each of them. 
            Not all of these work well with all player counts, see the list at the very bottom to get a quick overview of which games to check out for your number of players.

            These are not ordered best to worst, but I've tried to group similar ones together. THe main three groups are: trick evasion, unique scoring methods and bidding.

            <h3>Hearts</h3>

                This is the king of trick evasion games, with the aim of the game being to avoid taking certain tricks and to have the lowest score. 
                The game plays as standard trick taking (must follow suit) with no trump suit, passing 3 cards to another player at the start of each deal. 
                The catch? Every heart card you win gets you +1 point and the Queen of spades gives you +13 points.
                Hearts cannot be lead until they have been "broken", i.e. played off suit
                You also have the ability to "shoot the moon", which is when you take all of the point giving cards in a deal. 
                This will mean you don't gain any points and all other players gain 26 (or you just lose 26 points in some variants).
                There is a variant which I like where the Jack of diamonds gives you -10 points.
                This is probably the first trick-taking game everyone should try, there are plenty of ways to play this online against computers to get a feel of it. 
                The only downside about playing this with real people is that it only really works with exactly 4.
