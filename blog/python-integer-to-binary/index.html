	<h1>Integer to Binary in Python</h1>
	<p>While looking online I found a neat way to convert integers to a binary representation in Python without using the built in <code>bin()</code> function.
  This will turn any integer into an array consisting of the binary digits with the LSB on the leftmost side.</p>
	{% highlight python %}
  def binary_encode(i, num_digits):
  return [i >> d & 1 for d in range(num_digits)]{% endhighlight %}
	<h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>Let's consider an example where you want to encode the decimal number 50 into 10 binary digits as 0000110010 (LSB on the right this time, as convention).
    This involves checking if the LSB is 1, done by AND'ing the number with 1, and producing a 1 if it is and a 0 if it is not. Repeat this for the number of binary bits required.
    I've probably expained that terribly, so lets show it step-by-step:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>50 >> 0 = 50 == 0000110010</code>, AND with 1 to get 0.</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 1 = 25 == 0000011001</code>, AND with 1 to get 1</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 2 = 12 == 0000001100</code>, AND with 1 to get 0</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 3 = 6&nbsp  == 0000000110</code>, AND with 1 to get 0</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 4 = 3&nbsp  == 0000000011</code>, AND with 1 to get 1</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 5 = 1&nbsp  == 0000000001</code>, AND with 1 to get 1</li>
    <li><code>50 >> 6 = 0&nbsp == 0000000000</code>, AND with 1 to get 0</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore, <code>binary_encode(50,10) == [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]</code>.</p>
