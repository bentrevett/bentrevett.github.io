	<h1>Intro to Neural Networks I</h1>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Here is some text in a paragraph
	{% highlight python %}
	def foo:
	print("hello world!")
	return 0{% endhighlight %}
	</p>The code should have the endhighlight on the same line as the last line.</p>
	<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
	Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
