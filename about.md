My name is Ben Trevett.

I have a first class honors masters degree in Digital Electronics from the University of Sheffield.

I'm currently doing a PhD at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.

My research is in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and how these can potentially be applied to programming languages.

I'm also interested in reinforcement learning and computer vision.

I enjoy reading science fiction. My favourite authors are: Liu Cixin, Greg Egan, Ted Chiang, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Dan Simmons, Ursula K. Le Guin, Alastair Reynolds, Ken Liu and some others I have probably forgotten.
