        <h2>Me</h2>

        <p>I have a first class honors masters degree in Digital Electronics from the University of Sheffield.</p>
        <p>I'm currently doing a PhD at the Heriot-Watt University on applying machine learning algorithms to programming languages.</p>
        <p>My research interests also include reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms.</p>
        <p>I enjoy reading sci-fi, listening to podcasts and playing board games. I'm also trying to learn German, but it's not going very well.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>

        You can contact me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ben_trevett">twitter</a> or via <a href="mailto:bentrevett@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Major</h3>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis">pytorch-sentiment-analysis</a>: A tutorial on how to implement some common deep learning based sentiment analysis (text classification) models in PyTorch with torchtext, specifically the NBOW, GRU, bi-LSTM, CNN and Transformer models. Somehow got popular and has quite a few stars.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq">pytorch-seq2seq</a>: A tutorial on how to implement neural (deep learning based) sequence-to-sequence models in PyTorch with torchtext, by implementing six NMT papers. Also has quite a few stars and was used as a basis for the <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/torchtext_translation_tutorial.html">official PyTorch language translation tutorial</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification">pytorch-image-classification</a>: A tutorial on how to implement some deep learning computer vision models in PyTorch with torchvision. Covers: a basic multi-layer perceptron, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG and ResNet.</li>

        <h3>Minor</h3>

        <li><a href="projects/snake.html">snake</a>: Snake in Javascript.</li>
        <li><a href="projects/difference.html">difference</a>: A timed mental maths game in Javascript</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bentrevett/notes">notes</a>: My personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> notes in plain text. The notes are created with <a href="https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo">vscode-memo</a> but should be compatible with any markdown rendering note-taking tool, such as <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a>.</li>
